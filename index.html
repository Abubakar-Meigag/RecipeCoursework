        <h2>Active listening techniques</h2>
        <p>There is a big difference between hearing and listening, and listening is
            always more effective than hearing because it requires you to concentrate
            on the verbal and nonverbal messages being sent and to determine the
            meaning of those messages. At its best, listening is active, focused, and
            concentrated attention for the purpose of understanding the meanings
            expressed by a speaker. This points to the importance of effective
            listening:
            Effective listening is central to fostering interpersonal relationships with
            coworkers, leaders, and clients. It can affect one's relationship satisfaction
            and can be a determining factor in whether someone is an effective
            communicator. Effective listening can enhance your image as people will
            perceive you as intelligent and perceptive. Good listening can also help with
            your public speaking skills. As a result, you have the ability to analyze what
            you think works and doesn't work in others' speeches, which can help you
            improve your own speeches.
            Listening, in addition to other communication abilities, is a likely predictor
            of who gets promoted or receives other relevant rewards, such as status
            and power. Better listeners hold higher-level positions and are promoted
            more often than those with less-developed listening abilities.
            Finally, understand the components of being an active listener and critically
            apply them to your professional interactions. Realize your strengths and
            weaknesses as a listener and adapt accordingly</p>
